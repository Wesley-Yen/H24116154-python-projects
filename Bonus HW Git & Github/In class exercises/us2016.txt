Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have a simple closing argument for voters: A loss in Tuesday's election would be catastrophic.
With four days remaining before the election, the White House rivals are speaking in increasingly stark terms about the stakes of the race. Clinton is portraying Trump as someone who doesn't care about minorities and women. Trump, meanwhile, is arguing that Clinton flouts the law and says her administration would be consumed with constant investigations and distracting scandals.
Neither candidate is making an affirmative case for their own campaign, more comfortable keeping their opponent's flaws in the spotlight.
All the focus at this point is on who will be able to secure the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency. Clinton maintains the advantage, leading by four points in CNN's Poll of Polls. She is also ahead in key swing states such as North Carolina and Pennsylvania. But Trump's campaign senses momentum, cheered by recent polls in some blue-leaning swing states such New Hampshire and Colorado.
Both candidates are focusing on the states that can put them over the finish line. So far, Clinton's travel plans hint at a strategy of shoring up her strongholds to prevent Trump from breaking out while laying multiple roadblocks that would prevent Trump from winning 270 electoral votes.
